# Alexa Personal Assistant Companion Program for Raspberry Pi
# Modified by Simon Beal and Matthew Timmons-Brown for "The Raspberry Pi Guy" YouTube channel
# Built upon the work of Sam Machin, (c)2016
# This is a library that includes all of the web functionality of the Alexa Amazon Echo personal assistant service
# The code here was originally in main.py, but has been abstracted for ease of use (you should not need to change it)
